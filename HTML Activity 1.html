1. Contrast Loras College employs strong contrast to enhance readability and
navigation. Dark purple and black headlines (“Learn. Serve. Lead.”) stand crisp
against light backgrounds, while bright gold/purple call-to-action buttons such
as “Request Information” immediately grab attention. However, image-based hero
headers sometimes place white text directly over busy photos (see first image),
slightly hindering legibility. Adding a semi-transparent dark overlay would
improve readability without losing visual appeal. <img /> ![alt

  2. Repetition Consistency is evident throughout the site. The standard
  navigation bar—with consistent font, spacing, and color—persists across pages,
  reinforcing brand familiarity. Content blocks frequently pair an image on the
  left with accompanying text and a button to the right or below (second image).
  This repeated card-style layout supports rapid scanning and helps users locate
  relevant content intuitively. The site also sticks to its signature color
  palette (purple and gold) and typography pairing, bolstering a cohesive visual
  identity.

  3. Alignment The site follows a clear grid structure: headings, images, and
  CTAs align either flush-left or center, creating a balanced and polished
  layout (third image). On pages like the Campus Map, elements are organized
  neatly into columns— map visuals, legends, and building listings are
  well-aligned and clearly spaced. Consistent padding and margins contribute to
  a clean and orderly visual flow, supporting user comprehension and navigation.
  <h2>
    4. Proximity Loras effectively groups related items—each headline, summary,
    image, and CTA sits closely together in block units, signaling relationship
    (second and fourth images). White space between these blocks helps
    differentiate content types like featured stories, testimonials, and event
    info, aiding visual transition without overwhelming the user. A minor issue
    arises with the cookie-consent banner sitting close under the primary
    nav—this tight spacing disrupts visual hierarchy. Additional vertical
    spacing here would clarify the separation.
